# Multi-focus Image Fusion
Image Fusion is the combination of two or more images to complement each other's deficiencies. Multifocus Image Fusion is to combine two or more images to achieve an "all-in-focus" image. It is needed because of the limited depth of focus. We have developed this project for our Digital Image Processing course by utilizing the resources we refer to below. We used the Multifocus Image Fusion dataset that belongs to MathWorks. You can download the dataset from this link: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/70109-multi-focus-image-fusion-dataset
